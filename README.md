I’m currently working on projects related to data science, machine learning applications to time-series, computer vision, and NLP problems. I usually work on either the AWS or GCP cloud platforms, leveraging their efficient services to process data and build efficient CI/CD pipelines. 
I enjoy writing code adhering to established software programming principles.
